# FaceRecognition

Install Libraries of Python

pip install opencv
pip install face-recognition




Clone the repository in your system.

Then in known_faces make a folder of a persons name and add the photos of the person.

For example: There is a folder of "Tom" (Tom Cruise) under known_faces folder inside the Tom folder there are photos(data).
That will help model to recognise the face.

I have used 'hog' model that can run on 'cpu'. If you have a gpu use a 'cnn' model.
The model will recognise the face in realtime.


To run the program enter: python3 videoRecog.py
